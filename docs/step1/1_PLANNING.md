# Project Planning - TODO Management Application

## 1. Introduction
The **TODO Management Application** is a backend system designed to help users manage their personal tasks efficiently and securely.  
It provides **RESTful APIs** that allow users to register, authenticate, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks.  

The system emphasizes:
- **Security** → JWT-based authentication, Bcrypt password hashing, strict task ownership enforcement.
- **Scalability** → Modular, extensible backend that can scale from single users to enterprise.
- **Maintainability** → Follows SOLID principles, PEP8 standards, and modern practices.
- **Reliability** → PostgreSQL database with ACID compliance and structured schema.

---

## 2. Project Goals
- ✅ Provide secure authentication and authorization.
- ✅ Enable users to create, read, update, and delete their tasks.
- ✅ Ensure users can only access their own tasks.
- ✅ Store passwords securely using hashing (Bcrypt).
- ✅ Deliver modular and maintainable code adhering to SOLID.
- ✅ Document APIs using OpenAPI/Swagger for easy integration with frontend/mobile apps.

---

## 3. Scope
### In-Scope (MVP)
- User registration and login.
- JWT-based authentication system.
- CRUD operations for tasks (title, description, due_date, status).
- Role-based access (owner-only tasks).
- Error handling with standardized HTTP codes.
- Testing (unit, integration, security).
- CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions.

### Out-of-Scope (Future Enhancements)
- Task categories, tags, priorities.
- Notifications and reminders.
- Collaboration features (multi-user tasks).
- Frontend (web or mobile).
- Third-party integrations (Google Calendar, Slack, etc.).

---

## 4. Deliverables
- ✅ Backend API (Flask + PostgreSQL).
- ✅ Database schema with migrations (SQLAlchemy + Alembic).
- ✅ JWT-based authentication system.
- ✅ Test suite with coverage reports.
- ✅ Swagger/OpenAPI documentation.
- ✅ Deployment-ready setup (Docker, environment configs).

---

## 5. Success Criteria
### Security
- All user data stored securely (hashed passwords, JWT authentication).
- Users can access only their own tasks.

### Functionality
- Endpoints fully support CRUD lifecycle for tasks.
- Task status supports `pending → in_progress → completed`.

### Scalability
- System can handle growth from individual usage to enterprise.
- Modular design allows easy addition of features.

### Performance
- Initial release should handle **100 requests/sec**.
- Optimized queries with SQLAlchemy ORM + indexes.

### Maintainability
- Follows **SOLID principles**.
- PEP8 compliant codebase.
- Clear project folder structure for future contributors.

---

## 6. Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk: Security breaches** → Mitigation: Use Bcrypt, JWT expiry, SQLAlchemy (prevents SQL injection).
- **Risk: Poor scalability** → Mitigation: Modular architecture, database indexing.
- **Risk: Code complexity grows** → Mitigation: SOLID principles, modular file structure.
- **Risk: Data loss** → Mitigation: PostgreSQL backups, migrations with Alembic.

---

## 7. Conclusion
The TODO Management Application planning establishes a **secure, scalable, and maintainable backend system** that will serve as the foundation for a productivity management platform.  

The roadmap ensures incremental delivery, starting with **user authentication and task CRUD** as the MVP, while keeping extensibility in mind for future enhancements.
